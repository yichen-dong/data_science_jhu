# data_science_jhu

This is a repository for the work that I did for the Data Science course at JHU. 

- Module 2 was an introduction to the class
- Module 3 dealt a bit with visualizations
- Module 4 dealt with web parsing and using a SQLite database
- Module 5 dealt with Univariate and Multivariate analysis
- Module 6 dealt with generating distributions using numpy
- Module 7 dealt with inference
- Module 9 and 10 dealt with linear models
- Module 11 dealt with model evaluation
- Module 12 dealt with distance based Machine Learning
- Module 13 dealt with rule based Machine Learning

Also a bunch of problem sets scattered throughout the course. The code in the labs and the problem sets were written by myself
