    "\n",
    "**Failure to follow the directions will result in a \"0\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "The due dates for each are indicated in the Syllabus and the course calendar. If anything is unclear, please email EN685.648@gmail.com the official email for the course or ask questions in the Lab discussion area on Blackboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Labs also present technical material that augments the lectures and \"book\".  You should read through the entire lab at the start of each module.\n",
    "\n",
    "### General Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  You will be submitting your assignment to Blackboard. If there are no accompanying files, you should submit *only* your notebook and it should be named using *only* your JHED id: fsmith79.ipynb for example if your JHED id were \"fsmith79\". If the assignment requires additional files, you should name the *folder/directory* your JHED id and put all items in that folder/directory, ZIP it up (only ZIP...no other compression), and submit it to Blackboard.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * do **not** use absolute paths in your notebooks. All resources should appear in the same directory as the rest of your assignments.\n",
    "    * the directory **must** be named your JHED id and **only** your JHED id.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Data Science is as much about what you write (communicating) as the code you execute (researching). In many places, you will be required to execute code and discuss both the purpose and the result. Additionally, Data Science is about reproducibility and transparency. This includes good communication with your team and possibly with yourself. Therefore, you must show **all** work.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Avail yourself of the Markdown/Codecell nature of the notebook. If you don't know about Markdown, look it up. Your notebooks should not look like ransom notes. Don't make everything bold. Clearly indicate what question you are answering.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Submit a cleanly executed notebook. It should say `In [1]` for the first codecell and increase by 1 throughout."

    "### Reproducible Random Numbers\n",

    "\n",
    "1. For reproducible research, we need to record the random seed that was used to generate our results so they will be regenerated exactly the same.\n",
    "2. For sharing with others, if our text said there was some result, and the user re-runs the notebook, we want to get the same results.\n",
    "3. If we are creating a model, and we accidentally generate the best model ever, we want to be able to build it again.\n",

    "to print out a value you can use in either case. Do not just feed `int( time.time())` into the seed function. The whole point is to make the seed a constant. Numpy has ample documentation on its [random module](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/routines.random.html).\n",

    "4. We get 10 more random numbers by calling `np.random.rand( 10)`. Notice that these are not the same as the first call. You can think of `random` *in general* as generating a stream of random numbers according to some distribution which we just tap into. We get the first 10, the next 10, the next 25, etc.\n",
    "5. We set the random seed to the same random seed as before.\n",
    "6. We got the same first 10 random numbers. This demonstrates that setting the seed \"resets\" the stream of random numbers. This is what we want.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, before answering each question, we are going to want to set the random seed to some value. Do not do it inside a function that is getting called over and over again, set it at the start of the experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will talk a lot more about visualization later but for right now I'm going to introduce the *histogram*. A histogram is a means for visualizing the distribution of a variable. There are several variants and the libraries are sometimes confusing on this score. Absent any directions to the contrary, the histogram will calculate the absolute counts of the data. The usual alternative, at least with continuous variables, is to set `normed=True` and you will get a *density*. It is also possible through weigting to get a `mass` or *relative frequency* for a discrete variable.\n",

We would like to see what data from other distributions looks like whose first moment is about 32.5 (and whose second moment is about 0.325, if appropriate).\n",

Similarly, we can move from $\\sigma^2$ to $m_2$ and then use that as the second moment if needed.\n",

    "\n",
    "Based on this discussion, use $\\mu = 32.5$ and $\\sigma = 0.325$ to generate 25 samples from the Exponential distribution and repeat the same steps we did for the Normal distribution. Remember, you need to convert these into $m_1$ and $m_2$ and then $m_1$ and $m_2$ (if needed) into the parameter(s) you need."
